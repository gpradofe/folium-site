    q: "Is Folium open source?",
    a: "Yes! Folium's core engine is open source under the MIT license. You can self-host it, contribute to it, or use our managed API. Check out the <a href='https://github.com/gpradofe/folium' class='text-emerald-400 hover:underline'>GitHub repo</a>."
  },
  {
    q: "Can I self-host Folium?",
    a: "Absolutely. Folium ships as a single binary with zero dependencies. Run it on your own infrastructure with <code class='text-emerald-300 bg-slate-800 px-1.5 py-0.5 rounded'>docker run -p 8080:8080 folium/engine</code> and you're live. Enterprise plans include dedicated support for on-premise deployments."
  },
  {
    q: "How does pricing work? Are there hidden fees?",
    a: "No hidden fees. You pay per plan based on monthly PDF volume. The Free tier (100 PDFs/month) requires no credit card. Pro and Enterprise plans are billed monthly with no contracts — cancel anytime. Overages are billed at $0.01/PDF."
  },
  {
    q: "What happens if I exceed my plan's PDF limit?",
    a: "You won't get cut off. Overages are billed at $0.01 per additional PDF. You can also set hard limits in your dashboard to prevent unexpected charges."
  },
  {
    q: "How fast is Folium compared to Puppeteer or wkhtmltopdf?",
    a: "Folium generates PDFs in under 100ms — typically 20-50ms for standard documents. Puppeteer averages 2-5 seconds per PDF because it spins up a headless browser. That's a 50-100x improvement."
  },
  {
    q: "What template formats does Folium support?",
    a: "Folium uses JSON-based templates. You define layout, typography, tables, images, and dynamic data bindings declaratively. No HTML or CSS required — though we offer an HTML-to-Folium migration tool."
  },
  {
    q: "Is there an SLA?",
    a: "Enterprise plans include a 99.9% uptime SLA with dedicated support. Pro plans target 99.5% uptime. Status is tracked publicly at <span class='text-slate-500'>status.folium.dev</span>."
